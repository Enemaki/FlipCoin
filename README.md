## Overview

<h2>[screenshot]<h2> <img src="./design/Screenshot (83).png" alt="screenshot">

FlipCoin is a simple web application that randomly flips a coin between heads or tails when the coin image or button is clicked. It was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### What I learned

I really learnt a lot while building the app especially when it comes to using transforms and animations. I have always had issues implementing code that required animations but this project helped dive deeper into learning useful ways to implement them.


### Useful resources

- Google
- Chatgpt

### Built with

## Features
